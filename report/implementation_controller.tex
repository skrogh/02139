\subsection{Implementation}
This section contains the implementation details regarding the FSMd implemenmation of the vending machine controller.
Again, this will not cover the inputsyncronizer and clock manager since these are already provided.

\subsubsection{Display Driver}
All of the VHDL code relating to the FSMd implementation of the vending machine controller can be found in Appendix A. \\


The VHDL implementation of display driver design seen in figure \ref{display_sch} is found in listing 
\ref{display_top}.
This VHDL code shows the connections between the BINARY TO BCD modules and the segment multiplexer entity, that covers both the FSM and multiplexing.
The top level display entity does not contain the HexToSevenSegment entity, since this is connected directly to the segment multiplexer.

\subsubsection{Vending Machine CPU}
The FSMd cpu
