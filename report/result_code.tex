\subsection{Result}
As the code is not verry optimized it runs quite slow,
testing in \emph{modelsim} would therefore not be very effective,
furthermore the debounce feature takes quite a while to simulate.
Instead we have chosen to link to a video showing the processor vending machine.

\subsection{Resource consumption}
According to the synthesis report found in appendix B, the microcontroller uses 500 LUTs when running the vending machine program. 
This figure is not stable, since the microcontroller is programmed by resynthesizing the design with a different ROM.
This results in the synthesis tool performing optimizations on the design that we cannot control which leads to unpredictable resource consumption.
The maximum amount of resources we have seen the microcontroller use after synthesis is around 1300 LUTs.
The only theoretical resource consumption we can calculate is the number
of memory bits being used which is around 16Kbits with a filled ROM and RAM.
This is well below the limits of the Spartan-3E residing on the Basys2 board
which contains about 88Kbits of memory according to it's datasheet.
