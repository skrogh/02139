\begin{abstract}
    In this report we design and implement a controller for a simulated vending machine running on the Basys2 board.
    We implement the controller in two ways, as an application specific FSMd and as a programmable microcontroller running a vending machine program written in assembly.
    The microcontroller contains an 8-bit microprocessor with 16 internal
    accumulators that double as general purpose registers, support for
    16 by 8 GPIO pins, 256 bytes of single cycle RAM and ROM which contains the program for the microprocessor.
    After describing the design process of both the microcontroller and the FSMd, we conclude that adding complex features is harder in the FSMd
    implementation than in the microcontroller implementation, however
    testing is easier for the FSMd and the resource consumption is lower.
