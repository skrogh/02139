\subsection{Implementation}
Having aready drawn out the baselines of the datapath of the processor,
implimentation is relativly simple.

The \emph{VHDL}-code for the toplevel can be fund in listing~\emph{lst:uContTop}

The \emph{VHDL}-code for the input synchronizer can be fund in
listing~\emph{lst:uContSync}

The \emph{VHDL}-code for the \emph{Operations} entity can be fund in
listing~\emph{lst:uContOp}

The \emph{VHDL}-code for the \emph{RAM} entity can be fund in
listing~\emph{lst:uContRAM}

The \emph{VHDL}-code for the \emph{Reg} entity can be fund in
listing~\emph{lst:uContReg}

The \emph{VHDL}-code for the \emph{ROM} entity can be fund in
listing~\emph{lst:uContROM}, however this is empty from binary code,
as that would just be 600-some lines of binary gibberish - instead assembly
code will show the functions here. More about the assembler in the next section.
