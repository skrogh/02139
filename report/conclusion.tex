\section{Conclusion}
We have designed and implemented a controller for a simulated vending machine in two different ways. First as
an FSMd and secondly as a microcontroller running a program written in assembly and compiled to bitcode. 
The FSMd implementation is fairly limited and can only perform the most basic functions outlined in the
requirements in the exercise manual. The vending machine program running on the microcontroller however, has 
added functionality such as scrolling messages and the ability to show more than two digits of the 
\textbf{price} and \textbf{sum}. This was possible because the implementation time for new complicated features such as scrolÄºing messages is much faster on the microcontroller. \\

The resource consumption of the respective designs were 125 LUTs for the FSMd implementation and 500LUTs for the microcontroller implementation, however the figure for the microcontroller is not stable
because the synthesis tool performs optimizations that we cannot control. \\
