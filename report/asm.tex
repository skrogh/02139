\subsection{Assembly code and assembler}
Since writing binary code is a bit tiresome we wrote an assember,
so that coding the microprocessor would be a bit more managable.

The assebler has support for lables, when doing jumps
and constans can be declared in [bracets], these work for the \emph{sbr} and
\emph{sri} operations. Both binary and hexadecimal inpus are accepted

Registers r0-r15 are replaced by binary numbers and operations are replaced by
their respective binary codes. The whole thing is wrapped insinde the
\emph{VHDL} fund in listing~\ref{lst:uContROM}

This is a rather lenghty Java-application so it will not be included in the
appendix but the newest version can be found at:

A syntax highlighting file for the \emph{Sublime text2} editor lies in the same
repository.
